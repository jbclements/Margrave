#lang racket

; Originally written for SISC by tn
; Re-written for Racket by tn

; todo: string buffer in Racket to avoid long query-creation time

; todo: too much string manipulation going on here. Is it possible to send back more structured IDB data?
;       for example, why not send a triple: (collectionname, idbname, tupling-data)?

; todo: Use sets rather than lists for efficiency (we do intersections)
