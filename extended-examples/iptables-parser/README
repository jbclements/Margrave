1) Create a directory on UNIX with the attached files and the firewall script
2) In the firewall script, comment out commands that load kernel modules (a handful near the top of the file)
3) In the firewall script, change the IPTABLES variable to "iptables"
4) Add the current directory to your path

-- Alternative: In step #3, specify the path to the created directory for the IPTABLES command.  The goal is to have the system execute the custom iptables command as the firewall script runs.

5) Run "capture-firewall <firewall-script>".  This will produce iptables-firewall.p.
6) Load iptables.ss and run the function:

(compile-vocabulary "iptables-firewall.p" "iptables-firewall.v")

This will produce iptables-firewall.v.

You should now have a single policy file that contains 3 kinds of rules: ACCEPT, DROP, or LOG.  (LOG is like DROP.)  You should also have a vocabulary that includes the necessary addresses, ports, interfaces, and chains.
