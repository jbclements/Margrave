Instructions for the Margrave+Capirca demo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(1) Install Java (6 or later):
http://www.java.com/en/download/.

(2) Install DrRacket:
http://racket-lang.org/download/

(3) If you want to run Capirca, you'll need to download and install
Python 2 (tested on 2.7.5). (Make sure you have v2. Capirca may have
trouble running in Python 3.)
 
http://www.python.org/getit/

(4) Install the Margrave Racket package contained in this zipfile.

Open DrRacket (the graphical development environment for Racket) and
select the File -> Install .plt file menu option. Go to the File tab
and select margrave-31alpha-062213.plt. (You may need to change the
filter from "Racket Sources" to "Any" to see the .plt file.)

(5) Run definate (from the command prompt): 
python capirca-r242-MODIFIED/definate.py

(6) Run capirca (from the command prompt): 
python capirca-r242-MODIFIED/aclgen.py

(7) Load test.rkt in DrRacket and hit run. The script will be shown in
the top window, and the output will be shown in the bottom window.

Additional information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The capirca-r242-MODIFIED folder contains the standard
capirca-r242 distribution with two key changes: 

- lib/margrave.py: A (very basic) output module for Margrave's
  intermediate policy language. [New file]

- lib/aclgen.py: I modified this to always output Margrave policies
  for whatever ACLs it runs on. [Existing file, modified]
