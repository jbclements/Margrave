TODO (general) -- Some of these ended up as issues in github.

* CREATE, etc. (from load-policy reqs) need to be in parser and syntax->xml.

* no id given to show/get/etc. means use _last_ query result

* Parser errors should be much more friendly.

* XACML, SQS loading

* Racket Exception on eof, cleanup (see end of "m" function.)

* Need to update old test case suite. Include as many java tests as possible.
     (Run javatests XML command to trigger internal engine tests? Better: Test that invokes the JavaTests main().)

* Output is still quite unfriendly. Example: special handling for MSemanticException. 
The java engine throws it to say (e.g.) "I don't recognize that sort". 
Should give a friendly error message instead of an exception printout.

TEST: Warning message for size ceiling vs. user size ceiling

-------------------------------------------------------------

For future:

* Currently saving only the most recent EXPLORE's results.
   Would be nice to allow for more, but notify java when a request 
   ID becomes free (avoid memory hogging). (use will executor?)

* Basic syntax highlighting.
* Tie highlighting to parser errors
