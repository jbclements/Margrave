LIST IN PROGRESS
TN: Varun, do you see anything I've missed?


---------------------------------------------------------------------
We have two goals for the end of next week, both involving Margrave
in DrRacket:

(1) #lang margrave: accepting command strings, running them, and
returning the result(s).

(2) Support for _using_ Margrave as part of a larger program. (e.g.,
the superfluous check script).

#2 is implemented via the mtext, etc. functions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO (general):

* Add warning messages to model printing (and is-satisfiable?) 
        if the user ceiling is lower than the calculated ceiling
        or if the calculated ceiling is -1 (infinitary)

* CREATE, etc. (from load-policy reqs) need to be in parser and syntax->xml.
* ALL (for show/get) -> automatic iteration through all models
* no id given to show/get/etc. means use last (0 for now)
* Parser errors should be much more friendly.
* XACML, SQS loading
* Racket Exception on eof, cleanup (see end of "m" function.)


TODO (for #lang):
* Basic syntax highlighting.
* Tie highlighting to parser errors

TODO (test cases):

[TEST] Annotation output for models
[TEST] INFO pretty print
[TEST] pop/unpop, for cases
[TEST] pretty-print errors
[TEST] pretty-print exceptions
[TEST] unified pretty-printer function (mtext?)

* Need to update old test case suite. Include as many java tests as possible.
     (Run javatests XML command to trigger internal engine tests?)

* ** IMPORTANT: Look into SchemeUnit -- if we can start using this, test cases 
     will become much cleaner.
     
     
BUG: Annotations pretty-print truncating variable names in 2nd example_final get.     

-------------------------------------------------------------

For future:

* Currently saving only the most recent EXPLORE's results.
   Would be nice to allow for more, but notify java when a request 
   ID becomes free (avoid memory hogging). (use will executor?)
