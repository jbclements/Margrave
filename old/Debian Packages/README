This project was prompted by the Mancoosi MISC competition (http://www.mancoosi.org/misc-2010/)
What this project attempts to do is convert Debian-like package configurations (according to the CUDF specification -- primer: http://www.mancoosi.org/cudf/primer and complete spec: http://www.mancoosi.org/reports/tr3.pdf) into Margrave's format.

The file that does this is parsepackages.scm. Scroll down to the bottom of the file, and you will see a function called runPackageParser. Use this function to generate .v and .scm files (there is no information in the .p, so I am using a generic one called generatedconfig.p) from a CUDF package specifcation. You can then run margrave on the outputted files by running 'runGeneratedExample'.


Test data:
The raw file downloaded from the mancoosi website is rand0fefb3.cudf-1. From this file I created 5 files, the full*.txt files. These are * thousand lines of the specification (which is ~400,000 lines)

Already generated are the 50k, 100k, and full files. To run them, simply rename the .scm/.v to generatedconfig.scm/.v and run runGeneratedExample.


Testing the Parser:
This shouldn't be needed, but if so, there are also some files that test the parser. These are testPackageConfigurations(Small).txt and sampleconfig.p/v. testConfig.scm will run them, and testExpectedResults.txt will show you what you should get. To run testConfig.scm, simply run 'runPackageExample'.
