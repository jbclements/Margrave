  ; Suppose the two policies are Conference1 and Conference2: Conference2
  ; has a rule that Conference1 lacks.
  
  ; You can create your own change-impact query like so:
  
  (mxout "EXPLORE (conf1:Permit(sub, act, res) AND NOT conf2:Permit(sub, act, res)) OR 
            (conf2:Permit(sub, act, res) AND NOT conf1:Permit(sub, act, res)) OR

  (mxout "COUNT 0")

  (mxout "COMPARE conf1 conf2")
  (mxout "COUNT 0")
  (mxout "get one 0")
  (newline) (display "That was the change impact via COMPARE.") (newline)
  (pause-for-user)
  
  ; the ordering used by LAST is now the standard ordering given by the policys' vocabulary.
  ; To confirm:
  (mxout "INFO last")
  
  ; And of course, change-impact queries can always be re-used via the LAST keyword.
  (mxout "EXPLORE author(s) AND last(s, a, r)")
  (mxout "COUNT 0")
  (mxout "get one 0")
  ; A word of caution: If you use your own queries instead of the CHANGE command,
  ; be sure to provide a PUBLISH keyword, or the ordering may not be standard!
