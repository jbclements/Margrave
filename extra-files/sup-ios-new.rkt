; In progress: What do we WANT the superfluous checker program to look like?
; (Much of this syntax is not yet supported, and may not even be supported in
; the final version.)






; Originally written for SISC by tn
; Re-written for Racket by tn

; todo: too much string manipulation going on here. Is it possible to send back more structured IDB data?
;       for example, why not send a triple: (collectionname, idbname, tupling-data)?

; todo: Use sets rather than lists for efficiency (we do intersections)
