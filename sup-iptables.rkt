#lang racket

; Originally written for SISC by tn
; Re-written for Racket by tn


;; For use with iptables parser


; todo: string buffer in Racket (stream?) to avoid long query-creation time

; todo: too much string manipulation going on here. Is it possible to send back more structured IDB data?
;       for example, why not send a triple: (collectionname, idbname, tupling-data)?
; todo: similarly, why lists everywhere? Use sets for efficiency

; IMPORTANT
; This code is not yet complete, needs updating from the new sup-ios.rkt code.
; Will not run out-of-box.
