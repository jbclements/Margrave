! for simplicity, we do not block traffic from the DMZ
! (so in_dmz permits everything)
! We use the 10.* network as if it were public address space


! why did adding eq 21 to the end of the first 102 rule give us a weird ip addr sort?

! Not this: we want to NAT everything, not just the manager
!ip nat inside source static ip 192.168.1.2 10.100.100.100
